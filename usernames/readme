The file username-words.txt contains a sanitized word list that is used by the admin-only command-line registration feature to 
create usernames (edu.ucla.cens.awuser.CreateUserName)

The words in the file are either 4, 5, or 6 characters long. Two words from the list are chosen at random and 
concatenated to form new usernames. 

The words in the file are sourced from a master file called 2of12.txt which was retrieved from 
http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/12dicts-readme.html.

The file add-remove-user.properties contains a set of key-value pairs (java.util.Properties) used when both adding or removing
